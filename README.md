# Databricks_DataEngineering
This repository gives step by step guide to train machine learning model on Databricks. Libraries such as scikit-learn that are preinstalled on the Databricks Runtime for Machine Learning can be used for model training. In addition, MLflow can be used to track the trained models, and Hyperopt with SparkTrials to scale hyperparameter tuning.

This tutorial covers:

Part 1: Use Mlflow tracking to train the model\
Part 2: Hyperparameter tuning a better performing model with Hyperopt
# Notebook Organization

The notebook is organized in the following manner:

1. Load the dataset
2. Feature preprocessing
3. Define the model
4. Build the pipeline
5. Evaluate the model
6. Hyperpamrameter tuning
7. Make predictions and evaluate model performance
8. Requirements
9. Cluster running Databricks Runtime 7.5 ML or above
